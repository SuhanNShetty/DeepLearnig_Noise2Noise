# DeepLearning_Noise2Noise
A PyTorch implementation of Noise2Noise model for the Deep Learning course in the year 2022 at EPFL.
The implementation includes
 - Miniproject1: A noise2noise deep learning model using the full power of pytorch libraries for deep learning (optimizers, autograd, convolution, relu etc )
 - Miniproject2: The same noise2noise model is implemented using the tools developed from scatch (optimizers, autograd, convolution, etc)
