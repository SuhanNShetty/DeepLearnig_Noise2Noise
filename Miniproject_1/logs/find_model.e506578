Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/506578.1.q_short_gpu/matplotlib-b7gvcwtx because the default path (/idiap/home/sshetty/.cache/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
